BrachFitness.py

Module with a bunch of functions to calculate fitness for a GA evolving
a brachistochrone curve. Fancy words.

To use in your project, simply put this file in the project's working directory
and in your pyhton code - from BrachFitness import *

""" 
Returns the time needed for a point to travel with frictionless motion through the line segments passed as argument.
If the point cannot reach the final destination, -1 is returned. In case the individual is mis-represented, -1 is returned.

The individual passed as argument should be in the following
format: [ x0,y0, x1,y1, x2,y2, ... ,xi,yi ] - Assure that for every j < i, xj < xi.
Don't forget that (x0,y0) should be the starting point and (xi,yi) the final point in the brachistochrone curve.

Checks for errors in the individual representation. Returns false when:
- There is an height (yj) higher than the starting height.
- The points are not ordered in the x-coordinate or there are duplicate points in x.

This is actually not used by the function above, but if you wish to use it, go on. It can
save you some trouble.
